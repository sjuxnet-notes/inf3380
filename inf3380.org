* Motivations
  - Many problems in natural sciences benefit from large scale computations
    - more details
    - better accuracy
    - more advanced models
  - Example of huge computations - weather simulations
  - Traditional sigle-CPU computers are limited in capacity
    - clock freq 2 ~ 5 GHZ
    - memory     2 ~ 8 GB
  - Parallel computers are comming to the mainstream market
    - Multi-CPU with more cores on a chip
    - Many chips on one machine.
    - GPUs are more and more parallel and are used more 
      and more for heavy computations
* Random notes
  - Important with shared memory internally on a machine
  - Not confuse multitasking with parallel computing
    - Multitasking on multicore cpus used for several programs, for instance OS and browser
    - Paralel computing is for computing one larger problem divided in smaller tasks
* Learning goals
  - ``Parallel programming = seriel programming + finding parallelity + overhead´´
* Kort inføring i C
